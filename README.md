## 1. Kubernetes Fundamentals

### Introduction to Kubernetes

- **What is Kubernetes?**  
  Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- **Why Use Kubernetes?**  
  Kubernetes provides an efficient and automated way to manage complex containerized applications. It enables scalability, high availability, and resilience with minimal manual intervention.

- **Benefits of Kubernetes over Traditional Deployments**  
  Kubernetes offers automated scaling, load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities, compared to traditional manual deployment processes which are prone to errors and scalability issues.

- **Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm, OpenShift, and Nomad**  
  Kubernetes is the most feature-rich platform for container orchestration, providing more extensive support for multi-cloud deployments, scalability, and networking compared to Docker Swarm, OpenShift, and Nomad.

### Kubernetes Architecture

- **Master Node Components:**

  - **API Server**: The API server is the central management entity that exposes the Kubernetes API. It handles requests from clients and communicates with other components.
  - **Controller Manager**: Ensures that the desired state of the cluster matches the current state. It manages controllers such as the ReplicaSet, Deployment, and Node controllers.
  - **Scheduler**: Assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
  - **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that holds the configuration data and state of the Kubernetes cluster.

- **Worker Node Components:**
  - **Kubelet**: Ensures that containers are running in the required pods and reports their status to the API server.
  - **Kube Proxy**: Manages network communication and load balancing between services within the cluster.
  - **Container Runtime**: Responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports Docker, containerd, and CRI-O as container runtimes.

### Installation & Setup

- **Minikube**: A local Kubernetes environment that allows for the testing and development of Kubernetes clusters on a personal machine.
- **Kind**: A tool for running Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers, suitable for testing Kubernetes clusters in a local environment.
- **kubeadm**: A tool to set up Kubernetes clusters manually. It simplifies the deployment of a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.
- **Cloud Kubernetes Services**:
  - Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
  - Google GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
  - Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
  - DigitalOcean Kubernetes

## 2. Core Kubernetes Objects

### Pods (Basic Unit of Deployment)

- **Multi-container Pods**: A pod can run multiple containers that share storage and network resources.
- **Pod Lifecycle & States**: Pods go through several phases, such as Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, and Unknown.
- **Init Containers & Ephemeral Containers**: Init containers run before the main container in a pod to initialize an environment, while ephemeral containers provide an easy way to troubleshoot running pods.

### Controllers & Workloads

- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
- **Deployment**: Manages the deployment of pods and supports features like rolling updates and rollbacks.
- **DaemonSet**: Ensures that a copy of a pod is running on each node in the cluster.
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications, providing guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pod deployments.
- **Job & CronJob**: A Job creates one or more pods to complete a specific task, while a CronJob runs tasks on a scheduled basis.

### Kubernetes Networking

- **Cluster Networking Model**: Defines how pods communicate within the cluster and how they are exposed to the outside world.
- **CNI (Container Network Interface)**: A standard for configuring network interfaces in Linux containers.
- **Service Types**:
  - ClusterIP: Exposes the service only within the cluster.
  - NodePort: Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
  - LoadBalancer: Exposes the service through an external load balancer.
  - ExternalName: Maps the service to an external DNS name.
- **Ingress Controllers & Ingress Rules**: Define external HTTP/S access to services in a cluster (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, Istio).
- **Network Policies**: Define rules to control the communication between pods.

## 3. Storage & Configurations

### Persistent Data Storage

- **Volumes & Volume Types**: Volumes provide persistent storage for containers. Common types include emptyDir, hostPath, and Persistent Volumes (PVs).
- **Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**: PVs represent storage resources, while PVCs are used by pods to request storage.
- **Storage Classes**: Define different types of storage with dynamic provisioning capabilities.
- **CSI (Container Storage Interface)**: A standardized interface that allows the use of external storage solutions within Kubernetes.

### Configuration Management

- **ConfigMaps**: Used to manage configuration data, which can be injected into pods.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, which can be injected into pods as environment variables or volumes.
- **Environment Variables & Config Injection**: Provide a mechanism for passing configuration and sensitive data into pods.

## 4. Security & Access Control

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Service Accounts**: Provide an identity for processes running in pods, allowing them to interact with the API server.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines access policies to Kubernetes resources based on roles and permissions.
- **Kubernetes API Access Control**: Manages who can access the API and what actions they can perform.

### Pod & Cluster Security

- **Pod Security Standards (PSS) & Admission Controllers**: Define security standards for pod configurations, and enforce them through Admission Controllers.
- **Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux**: Security modules used to restrict system calls and resources available to containers.
- **Image Security**: Use tools like Trivy, Cosign, and Notary to scan images for vulnerabilities.
- **Securing etcd**: Encrypt etcd data and restrict access to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Network Security

- **Network Policies**: Control traffic flow between pods and services.
- **Service Mesh Security**: Implement mTLS (Mutual TLS) to secure communications between services in a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).

## 5. Scaling & Performance Optimization

### Autoscaling in Kubernetes

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Scales the number of pod replicas based on CPU or memory utilization.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**: Adjusts pod resource requests based on actual resource usage.
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster to accommodate resource demands.

### Resource Management & Optimization

- **Resource Requests & Limits**: Set CPU and memory resources required by pods, along with limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **QoS Classes**: Define Quality of Service for pods: Guaranteed, Burstable, and BestEffort.
- **Node Affinity & Pod Affinity**: Control the placement of pods on nodes based on resource requirements and affinity rules.

## 6. Observability: Logging, Monitoring & Debugging

### Logging in Kubernetes

- **kubectl logs**: Retrieve logs from individual pods.
- **Centralized Logging**: Tools like Fluentd, Loki, and the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) aggregate and analyze logs from the entire cluster.

### Monitoring Kubernetes

- **Metrics Server**: Provides resource usage metrics for pods and nodes.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: A widely used monitoring and alerting stack for Kubernetes clusters.
- **Liveness & Readiness Probes**: Configure probes to monitor pod health and ensure traffic is directed only to healthy pods.

### Troubleshooting Kubernetes Issues
